                <h2>QIB Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Welcome to QIB’s Privacy Policy (“Policy”). Thank you for taking the time to read it! </p>
                <p>We appreciate that you trust us with your information and intend to always keep that trust. We want to start this building this trust by ensuring that you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding your data. This Policy explains how we collect, store, protect, and share your information, and with whom we share it. We suggest you read this in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions of Use. While you're enjoying the QIB mobile application ("App"), we collect some information about you. In addition, you may choose to use the App to share information with other users of the App, including your friends and contacts ("Users"). We may also need to share your information sometimes.</p>
                <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this Policy. The personal information that we collect is used for providing and improving the App. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. Because QIB is based in the United States, keep in mind that your information will be sent to and used in the United States regardless of the country you reside in.
                </p>
                <h3>Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h3>
                <p>The Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by QIB. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Policy.
                </p>
                <p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy — not this Policy — applies.</p>
                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <h4>Information You Give Us</h4>
                <p>When you download the App and create an account ("Account"), we may collect certain information ("Registration Information") about you, including, but not limited to:

                </p>

                <p>If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.
                </p>
                <p>In a case of an error in the App, we might collect data and information on your phone called Log Data.
