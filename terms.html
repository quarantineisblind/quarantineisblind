                <h2>Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement</h2>
                <p>Welcome to QIB's Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms"). This is a contract between you and QIB and we want you to know your and our rights before you use the QIB Application ("App"). Please take a few moments to read these Terms before enjoying the App, because once you access, view or use the App, these Terms will automatically apply to you.
                </p>
                <h3>Eligibility of Use</h3>
                <p>Before you can use the App, you will need to register for an account ("Account"). In order to create an Account you must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>be at least 18 years old; and</li>
                    <li>be legally permitted to use the App by the laws of your home country.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can create an Account by using your Facebook login details or email address. If you create an Account using your Facebook login details, you authorize us to access, display, and use certain information from your Facebook account (e.g. profile pictures, name, email). For more information about what information we use and how we use it, please view our Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
                <p>You’re not allowed to copy or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the App into other languages or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Smooch, Inc.
                </p>
                <p>QIB is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.</p>
                <p>The App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us in order to provide our services. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, as well as compromise your phone’s security features, and it could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all.
                </p>
                <p>You should be aware that there are certain things for which QIB will not take responsibility. Certain functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but QIB cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                </p>
                <p>If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.
                </p>
                <p>Along the same lines, QIB cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the App. Most importantly, YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. We strongly advise you to use your best judgment in never falling victim to financial fraud and exercising caution when interacting with other users offline.
                </p>
                <p>With respect to QIB’s responsibility for your use of the App, when you’re using the App, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. QIB accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App.</p>
                <p>At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems to which we decide to extend the availability of the App) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. QIB does not promise that the App will always be updated so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you acknowledge that the App may not always work as intended unless certain updates to the App that are offered to you are accepted. If we wish to stop providing the App, we may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
                </p>
                <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions of Use</h2>
                <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes to the new Terms and Conditions of use. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.</p>
